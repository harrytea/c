#### compiler

A compiler is a program that reads a high-level program and translates it all at once, before executing any of the commands. Often you compile the program as a separate step, and then execute the compiled code later. In this case, the high-level program is called the **source code**, and the translated program is called the **object code** or the **executable**.

As an example, suppose you write a program in C.You might use a text editor to write the program(a text editor is a simple word processor). When the program is finished, you might save it in a file named **program.c**, where "program" is an arbitrary name you make up, and the suffix.c is a convention that indicates that the file contains C source code.

Then, depending on what your programming environment is like, you might leave the text editor and run the compiler. The compiler would read your source code, translate it, and create a new file named **program.o** to contain the object code, or **program.exe** to contain the executable.
